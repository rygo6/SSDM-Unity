# SSDM-Unity

Half-finished implementation of Screen Space Displacement mapping in Unity. 

Abondoned because I discovered that SSDM adds a kind of subdivion-like smoothing to the resultant displaced geometry and it cannot correctly displace sharp edges. This might be preferable for some use cases, but it was not for mine.

Unlicensed. Use for anything.
